# Introduction
This is the **Bioinformatics Stronghold** problem sets from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/). This part contains questions relating to nucleic acid analysis

# Problems
### Q1: Counting DNA Nucleotides
  - Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.
  - Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.

### Q2: Transcribing DNA into RNA
  - Given: A DNA string t having length at most 1000 nt.
  - Return: The transcribed RNA string of t.
  
### Q3: Complementing a Strand of DNA
  - Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.
  - Return: The reverse complement sc of s.

### Q4: Rabbits and Recurrence Relations
  - Given: Positive integers n≤40 and k≤5.
  - Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).
