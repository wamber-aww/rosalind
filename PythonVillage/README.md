# Problems

### Q1: Installing Python
  - After downloading and installing Python, type `import this` into the Python command line and see what happens. 
Then, click the "Download dataset" button below and copy the Zen of Python into the space provided.

### Q2: Variables and Some Arithmetic
  - Given: Two positive integers a and b, each less than 1000.  
  - Return: The integer corresponding to the square of the hypotenuse of the right triangle whose legs have lengths a and b.

### Q3: Strings and Lists
  - Given: A string s of length at most 200 letters and four integers a, b, c and d.
  - Return: The slice of this string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), 
inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.

### Q4: Conditions and Loops
  - Given: Two positive integers a and b (a<b<10000).
  - Return: The sum of all odd integers from a through b, inclusively.

### Q5: Working with Files
  - Given: A file containing at most 1000 lines.
  - Return: A file containing all the even-numbered lines from the original file. Assume 1-based numbering of lines.

### Q6: Intro to Python dictionary
  - Given: A string s of length at most 10000 letters.
  - Return: The number of occurrences of each word in s, where words are separated by spaces. Words are case-sensitive, and the lines in the output can be in any order.
